# To collaborate

To collaborate with the development of Argenmap, we suggest first checking in the issues section if there are changes or requests in process. You can also report bugs or propose ideas in this section.

The development team can also be contacted from the website of the National Geographic Institute.

To make changes to the app, we recommend making a fork of this repository and then requesting their integration through a pull request, which will remain for evaluation.
