[Spanish version][README]

Argenmap is a map viewer developed by the [National Geographic Institute][IGN] under a free license which allow load base maps, overlay layers from WMS and WMTS services, GeoJSON files, query their data and add extensions.

It is based on [Leaflet][] and only requires a web server to work. The app creates a panel with all the layers grouped in sections as they are defined in a JSON file.

The app comes with the Argentina Republic base map by default and more can be added.
